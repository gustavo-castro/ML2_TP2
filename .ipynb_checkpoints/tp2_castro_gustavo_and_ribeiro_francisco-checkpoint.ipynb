    "## 0.4 Running the computations\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, `TensorFlow` works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Declare a computation graph in which you define what are the inputs (`Placeholder`s), the `Variable`s, and the `Operation`s you want to perform with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "      with graph.as_default():\n",
    "          x = tf.placeholder(...)\n",
    "          W = tf.Variable(...)\n",
    "          ...\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can then run the `Operation`s on this graph as many times as you want by calling `session.run()`. A `Session` object encapsulate the environment in which `Operation` objects are executed, and `Tensor`s evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "      with tf.Session(graph=graph) as session:\n",
    "          session.run(fetches, feed_dict=...)\n",
    "          ...\n",
    "      \n",
    "The `fetches` argument may be a single graph element, or an arbitrarily nested `list`, `tuple`, `namedtuple`, or `dict` containing graph elements at its leaves. A graph element can be one of the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An `Operation`, e.g. \"run an optimizer step\". The corresponding fetched value will be None.\n",
    "- A `Tensor` (cf. examples above). The corresponding fetched value will be a numpy ndarray containing the value of that tensor.\n",
    "- and other options out of this tutorial's scope\n",
    "\n",
    "A session may own resources, such as variables, queues, and readers. \n",
    "It is important to release these resources when they are no longer required. \n",
    "To do this, either invoke the `close()` method on the session, or use the session as a context manager. \n",
    "The following two examples are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Using the `close()` method.\n",
    "    sess = tf.Session()\n",
    "    sess.run(...)\n",
    "    sess.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Using the context manager.\n",
    "    with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "        sess.run(...)\n",
    "      \n",
    "### Remark\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noted that the tensors declared earlier were not declared explicitely as being part of a graph. \n",
    "In fact, when you don't specify a graph when declaring tensors or initializing sessions, TensorFlow will use a \"default\" graph. When working on different models, using only the default graph might be messy. \n",
    "In the following, we will declare each model in a specific graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "    some_model_graph = tf.Graph()\n",
    "\n",
    "    with some_model_graph.as_default():\n",
    "        # Declare all your tensors and operations here\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "        \n",
    "    with tf.Session(graph=some_model_graph) as sess:\n",
    "        # Run some stuff\n",
    "        sess.run(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware though, different graphs are not different namespaces, i.e. if you declare a tensor `foo` in a graph `g1` and then declare an other tensor `foo` in a graph `g2`, you might have some trouble. \n",
    "The internals of TensorFlow are out of the scope of this tutorial, but you can find more details in TensorFlow [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/framework/)."

    "\n",
    "For the first part of this tutorial, we will use the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) dataset.\n",
    "This dataset contains images representing handwritten digits. \n",
    "Each image is 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel is represented by a number (gray level). \n",
    "These arrays can be flattened into vectors of 28 x 28 = 784 numbers.\n",
    "You can then see each image as a point in a 784-dimensional vector space. \n",
    "You can find interesting visualisations of this vector space [http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/) (but don't spend too much time looking at the cool graphs :))\n",

    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$ giving the digit on the image are be represented using one-hot encoding: labels in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$ are replaced by labels in $\\{ 0, 1\\}^{10}$, namely $0$ is replaced by $(1, 0, \\ldots 0)$, $1$ is replaced by $(0, 1, 0, \\ldots 0)$, $2$ is replaced by $(0, 0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0)$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST data is **already normalized** to avoid numerical instability.\n",
    "Indeed, working with big floats can lead to important numerical errors. \n",
    "It is a good practice to normalize the inputs (features) so that they have zero mean and a constant (small) variance. To convince yourself of the damages that can result from numerical instability, see the following cell:"

    "You should have reached an accuracy of around 0.9 with this simple model. \n",

    "\n",
    "MNIST is a very very **clean** dataset. Digits are rescaled, smoothed, centered, and pixel values are normalized beforehand. Let's switch to a slightly harder dataset: [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, labels are letters from 'A' to 'J' (10 classes). \n",

    "Intuitively, if the phenomenon you try to learn has a hierarchical structure, adding more layers can be interpreted as a way to learn more levels of abstraction. \n",
    "For example, if you are trying to recognize objects, it is easier to express shapes from edges and objects from shapes, than to express objects from pixels. \n",
    "Thus, a good design should try to exploit this hierarchy.\n",

    "For example, you try to detect a cat, but the cat can be in the middle or the left of the picture. \n",
    "Thus you need to build a model which is translation invariant: it is easier to learn how to recognize an object independently of its location. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1. Description\n",
    "\n",
    "When two inputs might contain the same kind of information, then it is useful to share their weights and train the weights jointly for those inputs to learn statistical invariants (things that don't change much on average across time or space). \n",
    "Using this concept on images leads to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), on text, it results on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). \n",
    "When using CNNs, you set weights to a small kernel that will be used to perform a convolution across the image.\n",

    "The image is represented as a 3-dimensional tensor: (width, height, depth). Width and height charecterize the size of the image (eg. 28 x 28 pixels), and depth the color space (e.g. 1 for grey levels, 3 for RGB pictures since each pixel is represented by a triplet $(R,G,B)$).\n",

    "Depending on the shape of the $W$ weights tensor, the tensor resulting from the convolution can have a different depth. Note that in the context of a CNN, the \"kernel\" can be also called a \"filter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing the convolution between the image and the kernel consist to move the kernel across the image, and to produce an output for each patch. \n",
    "The way you move across the image is defined by two parameters:\n",

To do so, the weights tensor $W$ should be 3x3x3x32 (in-height, in-width, in-depth, out-depth). \n",
